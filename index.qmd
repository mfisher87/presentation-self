# Intro

:::{.notes}
I'd like to tell you a little about who I am and my path to my current role!
:::


## Who am I?


:artificial_satellite: :earth_africa: :thermometer: :world_map: :technologist: Earth science software person

. . .

:thought_balloon: Neurodivergent

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:speaking_head: May overcommunicate when excited [(please interrupt)]{style="font-size: 0.6em"}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:abacus: :bar_chart: ["Systems (over)thinker"](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/20-things-ive-learned-as-a-systems)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:hugs: [Inclusiveness champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzi-qkl8u5M)

:fire: :mask: Surrounded by wildfires right now!


:::{.notes}
I'm an Earth science software person, but you already know that!

_NEXT_

<!-- alex ignore add -->
I'm **neurodivergent** - different than "neurodiverse", meaning "we all think
differently". "Neurodivergent" means I face unique challenges navigating a
world that is built for people whose brains work very differently than mine.
Living with autism and ADHD, I sometimes miss implicit social cues,
overcommunicate when I'm excited, and sometimes jokes fly over my head.  I may
also come across as nervous in this presentation - I overprepare to compensate,
so I'm reading a lot of notes.

**Systems thinker** - I'm very interested in systems, incentives, and culture.

Because I'm a bit different, I'm big on inclusiveness. This year I taught a cohort of
researchers about psychological safety, and that's recorded on YouTube and
linked on this slide.

_NEXT_

I love to repair things and modify things, and keep things out of the landfill.
I have a lot of hobbies. I love learning new things!

I love plants, animals, and music!

_NEXT_

It's wildfire season where I live. We've had at least a week of smoke. I'd
really like to learn more about mapping wildfires!

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore amateur -->
Here's a fun photo collage of some things that are important to me.

My partner is here, our amazing dogs Ricky and Waffles are here, our marigolds,
some dill and garlic we harvested, a flute I made from PVC pipe, my basement
music studio, my homemade microphone cables, my basement computing cluster, and
some other fun stuff.

I struggle with collecting, or maybe _hoarding_, hobbies.

:::{.notes}
I started off in the finance world, and though I was a long-time open source
user and "believer", I didn't begin contributing to the open source world until
2013. I didn't have the most welcoming experience, but we'll get in to that
soon!

In 2016, I made a career change in to research software engineering, and I've
been at NSIDC since then.

At NSIDC I've been in a new role of "NASA Openscapes Mentor" since 2023, which
is a program to mentor researchers in adapting to open science and cloud
programming practices, and through that program I got certified as a
Carpentries instructor. If you're not familiar with The Carpentries, it's a
program for teaching researchers the foundational coding and data science
skills they need. This has given me best practices and tools to effectively run
workshops and do one-on-one teaching.

:::{.notes}
As I was making the graph on the last slide, it was getting huge and
overwhelming, so I split it in to two graphs. This one is about things I
learned along the way that shaped my interests and guide my decisions!

In my very early career, I worked with a technical lead who dogmatically used
single-letter variable names and a lot of jargon, which created artificial
barriers for learning and getting work done. From this, I learned that
_readability is paramount_. Code is read many times more than it is written.

At first, I was satisfied working on interesting "big data" and distributed
systems problems in the finance world. Over time, I realized that _interesting
problems aren't enough for me_ - I wanted to do work that helped people in some
way.

I got interested in contributing to open source projects at this point and
learned the importance of welcomingness.
:::


## The importance of welcomingness

![My first pull request](/assets/first-pr.png)

:::{.notes}
[My first pull request was against a Yahoo project](https://github.com/yql/yql-tables/pull/405)
and was merged quickly but without any interaction. I was excited to learn or
get some feedback from a professional open source software engineer! This
wasn't an inspiring start for me, but I kept trying and learned how _good_ open
source can feel.
:::


## [Overcompensate for tone](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/)

Text communication lacks body language & vocal tone

Emojis can help!

. . .

<center>
:pinching_hand::sunglasses:

:pinching_hand::dark_sunglasses::raised_eyebrow:
</center>

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore easy -->
We all implicitly understand the value of body language and tone, and I
think it's easy to underestimate the potential for miscommunication when those
things aren't present. We can communicate better through text if we make our
tone more explicit, and pictures are great for that!

_NEXT_

I doubt it's surprising at this point in the presentation that I think emojis
are great.

## More?

:::{.notes}
There's much more to my professional learning journey, but I'll come back to that in
the context of a project.

# A project: QGreeenland

:::{.notes}
QGreenland!
:::

---

![](https://qgreenland.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/QGreenland_updates_2023.jpg){fig-align="center" .r-stretch}

:::{.notes}
QGreenland is an offline-first Greenland-focused data environment for QGIS.

The provided data ranges from ice sheet thickness to protected wildlife areas
to undersea features. It's built to work offline to support field work and
accessibility to data explorers.

It's inspired by Quantarctica, a similar project focused on Antarctica. The
advancement we made with QGreenland was producing open source software to
transform the data and build the QGIS project instead of doing those steps by
hand.

We're currently working on a follow-up grant (see bonus slides) to make more
data viewable online and move to a Conda Forge inspired model for data
transformation.

## Stakeholders: Learners

![Learners at a QGreenland workshop](/assets/qgreenland-workshop.jpg)

:::{.notes}
Our learners included students from high school and up, professional educators,
and researchers.

We held workshops for our learners and trained educators to create a pathway
into our community. A researcher workshop we held in 2023 was the first
workshop which I had a leadership role in developing, alongside my amazing
colleague Trey.

[_Desktop GIS software in the cloud with JupyterHub: A QGreenland workshop success story_](https://blog.jupyter.org/desktop-gis-software-in-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-ddced297019a)


### Further QGIS integration

<!-- alex ignore special -->
[Enable users to open a dataset in JupyterHub QGIS from a special URL](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-jupyterhub/issues/2)


:::{.notes}
This was a transformative experience for me. My work on the CryoCloud
JupyterHub, operated by 2i2c, brought a high quality QGIS experience to our
virtual classroom of 25 international students.

We were invited to write a guest post on the Jupyter Blog, which was credited
with inspiring further work to build an integrated QGIS user experience.

I'm very proud of this work, as it's been credited for inspiring additional
advancements in JupyterHub GIS functionality.

## Main takeaways

### :heart: I love teaching!

#### :speaking_head: Inclusive language is especially important for teaching

<!-- alex ignore of-course -->
~~"just"~~, ~~"simply"~~, ~~"easy"~~, ~~"of course"~~

### :open_hands: I really care about inclusive design

### :hole: ["Deep quality"](https://diataxis.fr/quality/) & [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

:::{.notes}
I realized that I like to teach. I especially enjoy teaching researchers to use
Git & GitHub!

I also realized the importance of inclusive language. Subtle language cues can
make a task more intimidating or discouraging than it has to be. I use an
automated inclusive language checker called "Alex" for this, including on this
presentation.

The remaining two have their own slides.
:::


## Inclusive design

![A [sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/the-curb-cut-effect) illustration showing that by designing for disability, for example with "curb-cuts", we make everyone's life better.](https://images.prismic.io/sketchplanations/f103d71e-0ecb-4e78-bc02-e6dce18d0ed8_SP+718+-+The+curb-cut+effect.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=1920&q=50){.r-stretch}

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore americans -->
I only recently first saw this illustration, but it's taken up permanent
residency in my brain and helps me make more inclusive design decisions. Many
take curb-cuts for granted in the U.S. They're ubiquitous because they're
required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and we all benefit from them,
as highlighted in orange.

In our workshop we taught our learners about inclusive design using colormaps.
:::

---

![](/assets/viscm-jet.png){fig-align="center" width=900px}

![](/assets/viscm-viridis.png){fig-align="center" width=900px}

:::{.notes}
There's a history in the sciences of using a notoriously inaccessible colormap
called "rainbow". In 2017, "viridis" superseded it at Matplotlib's default
thanks to work by Berkeley faculty StÃ©fan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith.

_CONTROL-CLICK the "jet" visualization_

<!-- alex ignore color -->
We can see how the top colormap is especially inaccessible to people with color
vision deficiency. Even for folks with full color vision, the gradient is
inconsistent and introduces false features and hides true features.

_CONTROL-CLICK the "viridis" visualization_

"viridis" more accurately represents data for all because it was designed for
all. That's inclusive design!

Thanks to StÃ©fan's welcomingness, I'm currently a maintainer of the software,
called "viscm", that was used to develop this new generation of accessible
colormaps. In 2023, I successfully revitalized and modernized it.
:::


## ["Deep quality"](https://diataxis.fr/quality/) & [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

* Functional quality: Measurable, objective
* Deep quality: Subjective, requires functional quality

:::{.notes}
Functional quality includes things like "is it correct?" and "is it complete?"

"Deep quality" refers to subjective experience: "does it meet human needs?",
"does it feel good?", and "how much of my energy does it take to use?"

<!-- alex ignore nuts -->
Diataxis provided me with a mental framework for me to start writing
software and documentation with "deep quality" in mind, and reinforced the
importance of "deep quality" for me. While Diataxis is a documentation
framework, it's changed how I think about quality in general.
:::


# Open source

## What does open source mean to me?

. . .

[:magic_wand: Magic]{style="font-size: 1.5em"}

. . .

People who know the needed thing (sometimes me!) can appear out of nowhere

. . .

People can get what they want by (kindly) making a wish

. . .

The best part is connecting with people

:::{.notes}
This is such a big question! I hope you don't mind that my answer is a bit cheesy.

Before I talk more about my open source roles, I want to introduce
_earthaccess_. It's a community-owned Python library built for researchers who
want to get to the core of their research, and makes data more accessible for
everyone.

On the left is the official documentation for how to access NASA Earth science
data, which is behind a login system called "Earthdata Login". There are _a
lot_ of things happening here, and the example isn't even complete.

(the code on the left side doesn't do that; it requires the user to know the
URL of a data file), and then downloading data with authentication.

## Roles in _earthaccess_


:gear: Core contributor & sustainability strategist

. . .

:hugs: Welcomer, thanker, community manager, & [hackathon facilitator](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/our-meet-ups/)

. . .

:money_with_wings: [Funding proposer](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess-proposal-2024-nasa-roses)


:::{.notes}
I've played many roles in open source software, from issue reporter to
maintainer, but I'd like to focus on my roles in _earthaccess_, where I'm
learning some new roles.

In _earthaccess_, in addition to being a core contributor, I work to improve
on a common problem: an open-source software project which stops responding to
community needs when funding for core contributors runs out. We've built a team
of maintainers both related and unrelated to NASA, from private sector and
public sector, and begun discussions about long-term independent governance.

_NEXT_

I also have a strong community role; I want our contributors to have the kind
of experience I would want.

I'm a facilitator for _earthaccess_' bi-weekly hackathons. Through this event
and by creating a welcoming environment, I've personally brought on several new
volunteer contributors to the project!

_NEXT_

Our core team submitted a proposal under NASA ROSES this year for more funding
to continue to evolve _earthaccess_' features, community engagement model, and
governance model.

## Other roles


:sparkles: Maintainer & modernizer

:package: Packager

:scroll: Documenter

:gear: Automator


:::{.notes}
I mentioned earlier my role maintaining and modernizing `viscm`.

I'm a maintainer of several Conda Forge package recipes (called feedstocks),
including Quarto (used to produce this presentation), `viscm`, _earthaccess_,
and at least three others.

I also really like writing documentation and automating things!
