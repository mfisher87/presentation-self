:::{.notes}
I'm an Earth science software person, but you already know that!

_NEXT_

<!-- alex ignore add -->
I'm **neurodivergent** - different than "neurodiverse", meaning "we all think
differently". "Neurodivergent" means I face unique challenges navigating a
world that is built for people whose brains work very differently than mine.
Living with autism and ADHD, I sometimes miss implicit social cues,
overcommunicate when I'm excited, and sometimes jokes fly over my head. I may
also come across as nervous in this presentation - I overprepare to compensate,
so I'm reading a lot of notes.

**Systems thinker** - I'm very interested in systems, incentives, and culture.

Because I'm a bit different, I'm big on inclusiveness. This year I taught a cohort of
researchers about psychological safety, and that's recorded on YouTube and
linked on this slide.

_NEXT_

I love to repair things and modify things, and keep things out of the landfill.
I have a lot of hobbies.

I love plants, animals, and music!

_NEXT_

It's wildfire season here in Boulder County. We've had at least a week of
smoke. I'd really like to learn more about mapping wildfires!

<!-- alex ignore amateur -->
Here's a fun photo collage of some things that are important to me.

My partner is here, our amazing dogs Ricky and Waffles are here, our marigolds,
a flute I made from PVC pipe, my basement computing cluster, my basement music
studio, my homemade microphone cables, and some other fun stuff.

I struggle with collecting, or maybe _hoarding_, hobbies.

:::{.notes}
_Point at the "Discover" section_

I started off in finance at Discover Financial Services working on their
distributed "big data" system for calculating and distributing rewards like
miles and cash back.

I started my open source journey in 2013. More on that soon!

In 2016, I made a career change in to research software engineering because I
wanted to do wor that was more meaningful and more aligned with my values of
openness, inclusivity, accessibility, and quality, and I've been at NSIDC since
then.

I've been in a new role of "NASA Openscapes Mentor" since 2023. Openscapes is a
program to guide researchers in adopting open science and cloud programming
practices, and through that program I got certified as a Carpentries
instructor. If you're not familiar with _The Carpentries_, it's a program for
teaching researchers the foundational coding and data science skills they need.
This has given me best practices and tools to effectively run workshops and do
one-on-one teaching.

I'll talk more about my professional learning journey in the context of a
project.

:::{.notes}
QGreenland is an open-source, offline-first, Greenland-focused data environment
for QGIS.

Our data ranges from ice sheet thickness to protected wildlife areas to
undersea features. It's built to work offline to support field work and
accessibility to data explorers.

We're currently working on a follow-up grant (see bonus slides) to make more
data browsable online and adopt a Conda Forge inspired community-driven model
for data transformation.

# :greenland: [2023 QGreenland Researcher Workshop](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io/)

:::{.notes}
A workshop for researchers we ran in 2023 was my first experience having a
leadership role in developing a workshop, alongside my amazing colleague Trey.

This was a transformative experience for me! I learned that I have a passion
for teaching.
:::


## [Open-source materials](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io) & [participation](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/repositories)

![Open participation by workshop attendees](/assets/qgreenland-workshop-discussions.png)

:::{.notes}
Openness was a core value, so all of our materials were developed openly on
GitHub, and all workshop participation also occurred publicly on GitHub.

## QGIS in cloud JupyterHub

![_QGIS_ in _JupyterHub_ with a user experience similar to a local desktop or laptop!](/assets/qgis-jupyterhub.webp){.r-stretch}

:::{.notes}
Accessibility was a core value, so we provided our participants with a stipend
and worked hard to provide accessible and robust compute resources for our 25
international attendees.

We designed our workshop so participants would work in the _CryoCloud_
JupyterHub (seen in the URL bar in the screenshot).

To make this work, I led an effort, standing on the shoulders of the Jupyter
community, to advance the QGIS user experience in the cloud to make it
comparable to a local desktop or laptop!

## :brain: Main takeaways from QGreenland {.smaller}

:scroll: A mental model for quality in documentation (and more)
:::

:::{.notes}
I realized that I like to teach. I especially enjoy teaching researchers to
write quality Python code and to use Git & GitHub!

I also realized the importance of inclusive language. Subtle language cues can
make a task more intimidating or discouraging than it has to be. I use an
automated inclusive language checker called "Alex" for this, including on this
presentation.

_NEXT_

I learned through the course of our work to enrich data of varying quality with
metadata andprovenance how difficult and valuable this work can be. With robust
provenance of data operations, moving an analysis to production is drastically
easier.

_NEXT_

I learned that inclusive design is really important to me.

_NEXT_

<!-- alex ignore nuts -->
And I learned a new mental model for quality that I can apply to documentation
and general design.
:::


## Inclusive design

![A [sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/the-curb-cut-effect) illustration showing that by designing for disability, for example with "curb-cuts", we make everyone's life better.](https://images.prismic.io/sketchplanations/f103d71e-0ecb-4e78-bc02-e6dce18d0ed8_SP+718+-+The+curb-cut+effect.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=1920&q=50){.r-stretch}

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore americans -->
I only recently first saw this illustration, but it's taken up permanent
residency in my brain and helps me make more inclusive design decisions. Many
take curb-cuts for granted in the U.S. They're ubiquitous because they're
required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and we all benefit from them,
as highlighted in orange.

In our workshop we taught our learners about inclusive design using colormaps.
:::

---

![](/assets/viscm-jet.png){fig-align="center" width=900px}

![](/assets/viscm-viridis.png){fig-align="center" width=900px}

:::{.notes}
There's a history in the sciences of using a notoriously inaccessible colormap
called "rainbow". In 2017, "viridis" superseded it at Matplotlib's default
thanks to work by Berkeley faculty StÃ©fan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith.

_CONTROL-CLICK the "jet" visualization_

<!-- alex ignore color -->
We can see how the top colormap is especially inaccessible to people with color
vision deficiency. Even for folks with full color vision, the gradient is
inconsistent and introduces false features and hides true features.

_CONTROL-CLICK the "viridis" visualization_

"viridis" more accurately represents data for all because it was designed for
all. That's inclusive design!

Thanks to StÃ©fan's welcomingness, I'm currently a maintainer of the software,
called "viscm", that was used to develop this new generation of accessible
colormaps. In 2023, I successfully revitalized and modernized it.
:::


<!-- alex ignore nuts -->
## A mental model for quality

* Functional quality: _"Is it correct?" "Is it complete?"_
* ["Deep quality"](https://diataxis.fr/quality/): _"Does it meet human needs?"
  "Does it feel good?" "How much energy does it take to use?"_

. . .

A framework for documentation: [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

:::{.notes}
Functional quality includes things like "is it correct?" and "is it complete?".
It's measurable and objective.

"Deep quality" refers to subjective experience: "does it meet human needs?",
"does it feel good?", and "how much of my energy does it take to use?"

_NEXT_

<!-- alex ignore nuts -->
Diataxis provided me with a mental framework for me to start writing
software and documentation with "deep quality" in mind.

# Open source

Now I'll talk about my journey as an open source software developer.
:::

## My first Pull Request (PR)

![[My first pull request](https://github.com/yql/yql-tables/pull/405)](/assets/first-pr.png)

:::{.notes}
My first pull request was against a Yahoo project and was merged quickly but
without any interaction. I was excited to learn or get some feedback from a
professional open source software engineer! This wasn't an inspiring start for
me, and it set the tone for me to establish more rewarding contributor
experiences later in my career.
:::


## Some of my open source roles


:wrench: Maintainer

:sparkles: Modernizer

:package: Packager

:scroll: Documenter

:gear: Automator

:mortar_board: Educator & workshop facilitator


:::{.notes}
Since then, I've taken on many roles!

I mentioned earlier my role maintaining and modernizing `viscm`.

I'm also a maintainer of several Conda Forge package recipes (called
feedstocks), including Quarto (used to produce this presentation), `viscm`,
_earthaccess_, and at least three others.

I also really like writing documentation and automating things! I think I've
contributed documentation and automation to dozens of open source projects.

And as you know, I love teaching.

:::{.notes}
Most recently, I've grown in to an open-source community builder on an
influential community-owned project called _earthaccess_.

It's a community-owned Python library built for researchers who want to get to
the core of their research, and makes data more accessible for everyone.

<!-- alex ignore special -->
On the left is the official documentation for how to access NASA Earth science
data, which is behind a login system called "Earthdata Login". There are _a
lot_ of things happening here, and the example isn't even complete.

On the right, we're doing exactly three things. Logging in, searching for data
(not supported by the code on the left; it requires the user to know the URL of
a data file), and then downloading data with authentication.

:money_with_wings: [Funding proposer](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess-proposal-2024-nasa-roses)


:::{.notes}
These are the new roles I've taken on in the _earthaccess_ project.

In addition to being a core contributor, I work to improve on a common problem:
when funding for core contributors runs out, many open source projects stop
responding to community needs. We've built a team of maintainers both related
and unrelated to NASA, from private sector and public sector, and begun
discussions about long-term independent governance.

_NEXT_

I also have a strong community-building role; I want our contributors to have
the kind of experience I would want.

I facilitate _earthaccess_' bi-weekly hackathons. Through this event and by
creating a welcoming environment, I've personally brought on several new
volunteer contributors to the project!

I strive to nurture the best aspects of open source, beyond merely "being
public", where work can be joyful, self-sustaining, and community-owned.

_NEXT_

Our core team submitted a proposal under NASA ROSES this year for more funding
to continue to evolve _earthaccess_' features, community engagement model, and
governance model. Link in bonus slides.

## Overcommunicate

Write for people who have the least possible context

[Create complete examples](https://github.com/mfisher87?tab=repositories&q=sscce&type=&language=&sort=)

:::{.notes}
I learned that I can leverage my tendency to overcommunicate to effectively
communicate asynchronously. I often communicate with excessive context and
complete, functioning examples, and you can find that in my history of GitHub
issues and repositories!
:::

## [Overcompensate for tone](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/)

Text communication lacks body language & vocal tone

Emojis can help!

. . .

> :star_struck: We need to talk!

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore easy -->
We all implicitly understand the value of body language and tone, and I
think it's easy to underestimate the potential for miscommunication when those
things aren't present. We can communicate better through text if we make our
tone more explicit, and pictures are great for that!

_NEXT_

I doubt it's surprising  that I think emojis are great after what you've seen
so far!

_NEXT_

Emojis make a huge difference in clarifying the tone of a message that could
otherwise be intimidating to receive.
