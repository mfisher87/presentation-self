# Intro

:::{.notes}
Who am I? And my path to my current role.
:::


## Who am I?


:brain: Neurodivergent

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:thought_balloon: ["Systems (over)thinker"](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/20-things-ive-learned-as-a-systems)

:screwdriver: Tinkerer & hobby collector

:dog: Plant and animal lover

:fire: Surrounded by wildfires right now


:::{.notes}
Who am I? What defines me and how I engage with the world? What is alive in me
right now?

**Neurodivergent** - different than "neurodiverse", meaning "we all think
differently", "neurodivergent" means I face unique challenges navigating a
world that is built for people who think very differently than me.

**Systems thinker** - Show me the incentives, I'll show you the outcomes.

**Tinkering & hobbies** - ...

**Plants and animals** -

This is what happened to bring me to my current professional identity - what I
specialize in and the values that guide my actions. I of course learned plenty
of other lessons along the way, but these ones shaped who I am today as an open
source research software engineer.

Some of the timing is best effort.

_TODO: break the below out into slides_

**Readability is paramount** - Working with a lead who dogmatically used
single-letter variable names and jargon.

**Interesting problems aren't enough for me** - At first, I was fairly
satisfied working in the finance world on large distributed systems solving
problems with "big data". Over time, I realized that I wanted to do work that
helped people in some way.

# A project: QGreeenland

:::{.notes}
QGreenland is a Greenland-focused interdiscplinary science data environment for
the QGIS open-source geospatial visualization and analysis software. Our data
ranges from ice sheet thickness and concentration to protected wildlife areas
to 

It's strongly inspired by Quantarctica, a similar project focused on
Antarctica. The advancement we made with QGreenland was producing open source
software to transform the data and build the QGIS project instead of creating
the project by hand.

We made it on to the Greenlandic news. I just think this is super cool, and I'm super proud of it.

That's me in the top-left with my wonderful unofficial therapy dog, Ricky.

Trey and I wrote QGreenland's source code with Twila's leadership. Alyse and
Casey produced amazing educational materials and advised Trey and myself in
leading our first workshop as part of the QGreenland project.

This is just some fun art the team found in Greenland. On the right-hand-side,
Greenland's iconic colorful structures are represented against its white

Our domain experts. They know their data; some EB members personally authored
datasets present in QGreenland. They help us to ensure the data we are
representing in QGreenland is accurate, and help us to curate datasets that are
useful to our audiences, and useful together.
