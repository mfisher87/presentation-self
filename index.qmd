I'd like to tell you a little about who I am and my path to my current role!

## Who am I?

:::{.notes}
Who am I? What defines me and how I engage with the world? What is alive in me
right now?

I'm an Earth science software person, but you already know that!

<!-- alex ignore add -->
**Neurodivergent** - different than "neurodiverse", meaning "we all think
differently", "neurodivergent" means I face unique challenges navigating a
world that is built for people who think very differently than me. Living with
autism and ADHD, I sometimes miss implicit social cues, overcommunicate when
I'm excited, or subtle jokes fly over my head. I may also come across as
nervous in this presentation - I overprepare to compensate, so I'm reading a
lot of notes.

**Systems thinker** - I'm very interested in systems, incentives, and culture.

Because I'm a bit different, I'm big on inclusiveness. I taught a cohort of
researchers about psychological safety this year, and that talk is recorded on
YouTube and linked on this slide.

I love to repair things and modify things, and keep things out of the landfill.
I have a lot of hobbies. I love learning new things!

<!-- alex ignore fire -->
_Read off the rest of the things from the slide, except the fire one._

It's wildfire season where I live. We've had at least a week of smoke. I'd
really like to learn more about mapping wildfires!

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore amateur -->
Here's a fun photo collage of some things that are important to me. My
partner is here, my amazing dogs Ricky and Waffles are here, my marigolds, some
dill and garlic we harvested, a flute I made from PVC pipe, my basement music
studio, some homemade microphone cables, my basement computing cluster,
and some other fun stuff. I struggle with collecting, or maybe _hoarding_
hobbies.

:::{.notes}
This is what happened to bring me to my current official job duties.

I started off in the finance world, and though I was a long-time open source
user and advocate, I didn't begin contributing to the open source world until
2013. I didn't have the most welcoming experience, but we'll get in to that
soon!

In 2016, I made a career change in to research software engineering, and I've
been at NSIDC since then.

There's a lot of other stuff on here, but I don't want to get too detailed. I
do want to mention the NASA Openscapes Mentor program. I've been a NASA
Openscapes Mentor since 2023, and through that program I got certified as a
Carpentries instructor. If you're not familiar with The Carpentries, it's a
program for teaching researchers the foundational coding and data science
skills they need. This has given me best practices and tools to effectively run
workshops and do one-on-one teaching.

:::{.notes}
This is what happened to bring me to my current professional identity - what I
specialize in and the values that guide my actions. I learned plenty of other
lessons along the way, but these ones shaped who I am today. I'd like to spend
a little more time on this concept, but don't worry, we're not going to dwell
too long on this slide.

At Discover, I was working with a lead who dogmatically used single-letter
variable names and jargon, missing opportunities to teach colleagues reading
their code. From this, I learned that _readability is paramount_. Code is read
many times more than it is written.

At first, I was fairly satisfied working in the finance world on large
distributed systems solving problems with "big data". Over time, I realized
that _interesting problems aren't enough for me_ - I wanted to do work that
helped people in some way.

I got interested in contributing to open source projects at this point, and my
first contribution was to a Yahoo project called "YQL" for querying stock
prices. [My first pull request](https://github.com/yql/yql-tables/pull/405) was
merged the same day without interaction. This wasn't an inspiring start for me,
but I kept trying and learned how _good_ open source can feel. And I learned
that _welcomingness is critical_.

Again, there's a lot more on this slide, and I'm going to focus on what's most
meaningful and unique to me. It was a hard choice, but I'm going to skip FAIR &
CARE principles.
:::


## [Overcommunicate & overcompensate for tone](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/)

* Write for people who have the minimum possible context

. . .

* Text communication lacks body language & vocal tone
  * Emojis can help!

. . .

<center>
:pinching_hand::sunglasses:

:pinching_hand::dark_sunglasses::raised_eyebrow:
</center>

:::{.notes}
This is a place where I can leverage my tendency to overcommunicate to
effectively communicate with larger groups, for example a software development
team that might not all be working on similar things at the same time. I often
communicate with excessive context and complete, functioning examples, and you
can find that in my history of GitHub issues!

<!-- alex ignore easy -->
I feel emojis are a key part of communicating professionally in a remote-work
world. We all implicitly understand the value of body language and tone, and I
think it's easy to underestimate the potential for miscommunication when those
things aren't present. We can communicate better through text if we make our
tone explicit, and pictures are great for that!

_NEXT_

I doubt it's surprising at this point in the presentation that I think emojis
are great.

## More?

:::{.notes}
There's more to my professional journey, but I'll get in to that later in the
context of a project.

:::{.notes}
QGreenland is a Greenland-focused interdiscplinary science data environment for
the QGIS open-source geospatial visualization and analysis software. Our data
ranges from ice sheet thickness to protected wildlife areas to undersea
features. It's built to work offline to support field work and accessibility to
data explorers.

It's strongly inspired by Quantarctica, a similar project focused on
Antarctica. The advancement we made with QGreenland was producing open source
software to transform the data and build the QGIS project instead of creating
the project by hand.

## Main takeaways

### :heart: I love teaching!

#### :speaking_head: Inclusive language is especially important for teaching

<!-- alex ignore of-course -->
~~"just"~~, ~~"simply"~~, ~~"easy"~~, ~~"of course"~~

### :open_hands: I really care about inclusive design

### :hole: ["Deep quality"](https://diataxis.fr/quality/) & [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

:::{.notes}
It's hard for me to select a small number. I learned much more, but these stand
out the most.

I realized that I like to teach. I especially enjoy teaching researchers to use
Git & GitHub!

I also realized the importance of inclusive language. Subtle language cues can
make a task more intimidating or discouraging than it has to be. I use an
automated inclusive language checker called "Alex" for lots of stuff, including
this presentation.

The remaining two get their own slides.
:::


## Inclusive design

![A [sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/the-curb-cut-effect) illustration showing that by designing for disability, for example with "curb-cuts", we make everyone's life better.](https://images.prismic.io/sketchplanations/f103d71e-0ecb-4e78-bc02-e6dce18d0ed8_SP+718+-+The+curb-cut+effect.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=1920&q=50){.r-stretch}

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore americans -->
I only recently first saw this illustration, but it's taken up permanent
residency in my brain and helps me make more inclusive design decisions. Many
take curb-cuts for granted in the U.S. They're ubiquitous because they're
required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and we all benefit from them.

In our workshop we taught our learners a little about inclusive design using
colormaps.
:::

---

![](/assets/viscm-jet.png){fig-align="center" width=900px}

![](/assets/viscm-viridis.png){fig-align="center" width=900px}

:::{.notes}
There's a history in the sciences of using a notoriously inaccessible colormap
called "rainbow".

In 2017, the Matplotlib team made waves by changing their default colormap from
"rainbow" to "viridis", an accessible colormap which was developed by UC
Berkeley faculty members StÃ©fan van der Walt and Nathaniel J. Smith. They
developed software to build and analyze such colormaps called `viscm`.

The visualizations on this slide were produced by `viscm`. They show how this
change to default to an accessible colormap provides benefits for all.

_CONTROL-CLICK the "jet" visualization_

<!-- alex ignore color -->
The "rainbow" colormap produces false features and can cover up real features
because it is not perceptually uniform. The visualizations at the bottom of
this group, and the black-and-white visualization, show how this impacts people
with color vision deficiencies even more then people with perfect vision.

_CONTROL-CLICK the "viridis" visualization_

"viridis" more accurately represents the data for all because it was designed
for all. That's inclusive design!

I'm proud to say that the reason I could create these visualizations for this
presentation today is because I was inspired by Nathaniel and StÃ©fan's work to
take on a maintainer role of the `viscm` project in 2023 and through that role
I restored it from a broken state!
:::


## ["Deep quality"](https://diataxis.fr/quality/) & [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

* Functional quality: Measurable, objective
* Deep quality: Subjective, requires functional quality

:::{.notes}
Functional quality includes things like "is it correct?" and "is it complete?"

"Deep quality" refers to subjective experience: "does it meet human needs?",
"does it feel good?", and "how much of my energy does it take to use?"

<!-- alex ignore nuts -->
Diataxis provided me with a mental framework for me to start writing
software and documentation with "deep quality" in mind, and reinforced the
importance of "deep quality" for me. While Diataxis is a documentation
framework, it's changed how I think about quality in general.

## QGreenland-Net

[Follow-up NSF award](https://qgreenland-net.github.io/) :tada: :cloud:

:::{.notes}
<!-- alex ignore executed -->
We applied for and received an award to build on this work, in collaboration
with Arctic Data Center (ADC), by generalizing QGreenland's data transformation
component into a system of community-owned data transformation recipes which
are executed in the cloud, taking inspiration from Conda Forge.

# Open source

## What does open source mean to me?

. . .

[:magic_wand: Magic]{style="font-size: 1.5em"}

. . .

People who know the needed thing (sometimes me!) can appear out of nowhere

. . .

People can get what they want by (kindly) making a wish

. . .

The best part is connecting with people

This is such a big question! I hope you don't mind that my answer is a bit cheesy.

Before I talk more about my open source roles, I want to introduce
_earthaccess_. It's a community-owned Python library built for researchers who
want to get to the core of their research, and makes data more accessible for
everyone.

<!-- alex ignore special -->
On the left is the official documentation for how to access NASA Earth science
data, which is behind a login system called "Earthdata Login". There are _a
lot_ of things happening here. The user must define a class which adds special
behavior to a Python HTTP client library. Notice the comment at the end:
"handle errors here". There's still more to do!

On the right, we're doing exactly three things. Logging in, searching for data
(the code on the left side doesn't do that; it requires the user to know the
URL of a data file), and then downloading data with authentication.

## Roles in _earthaccess_


:gear: Core contributor & sustainability strategist

. . .

:hugs: Community manager & [hackathon facilitator](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/our-meet-ups/)

. . .

:money_with_wings: [Funding proposer](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess-proposal-2024-nasa-roses)


:::{.notes}
I've played many roles in open source software, from issue reporter to
maintainer, but I'd like to focus on my roles in _earthaccess_, where I'm
learning some new roles.

In _earthaccess_, in addition to being a core contributor, I work to improve
on a common problem: an open-source software project which stops responding to
community needs when funding for core contributors runs out. We've built a team
of maintainers from many organizations, both related and unrelated to NASA,
both private sector and public sector, and begun discussions about long-term
independent governance.

_NEXT_

I'm a facilitator for _earthaccess_' bi-weekly hackathons. Through this event
and by creating a welcoming environment, I've personally brought on several new
volunteer contributors to the project!

_NEXT_

Our core team submitted a proposal under NASA ROSES this year for more funding
to continue to evolve _earthaccess_' features, community engagement model, and
governance model.

## Other roles


:sparkles: Maintainer & modernizer

:package: Packaging maintainer

:scroll: Documenter


:::{.notes}
I mentioned earlier my role maintaining and modernizing `viscm`.

Conda Forge is a community-driven system for enabling software to be installed
with `conda`. I'm a maintainer of several Conda Forge package recipes (called
feedstocks), including Quarto (used to produce this presentation), `viscm`,
pangeo-forge-runner, _earthaccess_, bump-my-version, coloraide, and more.

I really like writing documentation! We talked about documentation a bit
already on my "deep quality" slide.
